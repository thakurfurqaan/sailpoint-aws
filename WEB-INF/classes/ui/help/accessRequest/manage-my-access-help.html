<h3>Selecting or Creating Accounts</h3>

<p>If the current user has multiple accounts on the
application associated with the access you are requesting, you are prompted to
choose which account to add the access to.</p>

<p>If your system is configured to let you request a new
account for a user as part of an access request, you are prompted to choose
whether you want to add access to the user's existing account or to create a
new account.</p>

<h3>Permitted Roles</h3>

<p>If you select a role that permits additional roles, you are
alerted that additional, optional roles are available, and can select any of
them to add to the request.</p>

<p>The option to remove access is available only when a single
user is selected. If you have selected multiple users, you will not see the <strong>Remove
Access</strong> option.</p>

<p>To remove access from the user, first click <strong>Remove Access</strong>
in the header area. Then click the X icon for each item to remove it from the user.

<h2>Review and Submit</h2>

requesters to set a priority level for access requests, you can change the
priority for this request. The default setting is <strong>Normal Priority</strong>. When
you create an access request, you can change the priority to <strong>High Priority</strong>
or <strong>Low Priority<br>

allow sunrise (assignment) and sunset (deprovisioning) dates for roles and
entitlements, you can click the Calendar icon to set these dates. Sunrise and

<p>Before you submit the request, you can use the navigation
bar to return to the <strong>Select Users</strong> and <strong>Manage Access</strong> pages to make
changes. Some changes, such as adding more users to the request, may reset some
of the selections you have made. </p>

<h3>Policy Violations</h3>

<p>IdentityIQ can be configured to alert you if your request
will result in a policy violation. If this option is enabled, you will see a
warning message for any potential policy violations. You can choose to change
the request to remove one or more of the conflicting items, or you can submit
the request with the violation. You can also click on the policy violation rule
name to see details about the violation, including compensating controls and
correction advice.</p>
