  <strong>Enable Revocation Period</strong>
</p>
<p>Enabling a revocation period makes IdentityIQ periodically scan identities to determine whether the requested remediations
have been carried out. Remediation occurs whether or not a Revocation period is enabled, but when the Revocation period is

are not tracked.</p>

(for example, by transferring responsibility to the certifier&#39;s manager). You can only add revocation notifications if
