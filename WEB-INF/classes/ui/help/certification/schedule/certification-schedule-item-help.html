<h2>What Do You Want To Certify</h2>
<p>Choose whether to certify Roles and Entitlements, or Accounts Only.</p>
<p><strong>Add Filter:</strong> you can filter the Roles/Entitlements or Accounts to include in the certification, using operations like Equals, Not Equals, or Starts With. You can choose the values for the filter from a list, or type them in. You can only type in valid values.</p>
<p>You can choose more than one value for any one filter. When you do this, the criteria works as an “or” operation, so the certification will include all entities meeting any of the criteria. For example, filtering on Owner Equals and entering two identities will select roles/accounts owned by either of those identities.</p>
<p>Add more filters if you want to filter on more than one attribute using an “and” condition. With multiple filters, entities have to meet each of the sets of filter criteria in order to be included. For example, filtering accounts on Service Account Equals True and Application Equals Active_Directory will select only service accounts on the Active Directory application.</p>
<p>For <strong>Roles and Entitlements</strong>, you can add more criteria that is specific to entitlements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check <strong>Additional Entitlements</strong> to include entitlements that are not contained in a role. If you check this option, you can also add filtering criteria to choose the entitlements to include.</li>
  <li>Check <strong>Include Accounts without Entitlements</strong> to include accounts that have no entitlement attributes.</li>
  <li>Check <strong>Target Permissions</strong> to include the actions a user can perform on an Unstructured Target such as a file share or folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Include Policy Violations:</strong> Policies are rules that enforce your enterprise’s business policies on separation of duty, activity, and risk. Violations of those policies can be included in the access reviews generated by the certification.</p>
<p><strong>Include IdentityIQ Capabilities:</strong> Capabilities control access to pages, tabs, and fields within the IdentityIQ product itself.</p>
<p><strong>Include IdentityIQ Scopes:</strong> Scopes are used to restrict access to objects in IdentityIQ. If scoping is enabled in your implementation, you can include Scopes in the certification.</p>
<p>The next two options apply to logical applications, which are applications formed by the detection of accounts from other applications, called "tier" applications, in existing Identity Cubes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclude Logical Tier Entitlements:</strong> Exclude entitlements on tier application accounts from the certification. This applies only to logical applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Filter Logical Application Entitlements:</strong> Allow logical entitlements defined on the logical application's managed entitlement list to be included in the certification. Any logical application entitlements are filtered from the tier application entitlements.</li>
</ul>
