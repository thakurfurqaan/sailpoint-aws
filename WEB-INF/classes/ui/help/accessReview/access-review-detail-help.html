<h2>Tabs</h2>

<p><strong>Important</strong> - items that require immediate attention: policy
violations, challenge items, and delegated items that have been returned without
a decision by the user they were delegated to. If the certification was
configured to require Delegation Review, delegated items that have been completed
and are ready for review will also appear on this tab. If you don't have any
review items in these categories, the Important tab does not appear.</p>

<p><strong>Open</strong> - items awaiting your attention, excluding any items
listed on the Important tab.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong> - items that you have completed for this access
review. Depending on your certification's settings and the phase, you can change
decisions from this tab until the access review has been completed and signed
off</p>

<h3>Organizing How Items Are Displayed</h3>

<p>Click <strong>Columns</strong> to choose what information is shown, and in
what order. Drag column tiles to rearrange them, and click <strong>Add Column</strong> to
add new columns or remove columns from the display. Some columns can not be removed. </p>

<p><strong>Group By</strong> lets you organize your review items by a number
of things - for example, by application or by user. When you choose an option
for grouping items, the <strong>Group By</strong> button turns green and shows the group
criteria, to indicate that grouping has been applied. To undo grouping, click the Group By button and clear the checkmark from the grouping choice.</p>

<p>Use <strong>Filter</strong> to display a subset of your items. Some
standard filter fields are provided; you can also add your own filtering option.
Define your filter, then click <strong>Apply</strong>; the Filter button turns green when
a filter is applied, to alert you that you are seeing a filtered subset of
items. To clear the filter, click <strong>Filter</strong> again, then choose <strong>Clear</strong>.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>List</strong> option in the upper left to view a list of
items organized by entity, such as user, account group, or role (depending on
the certification type). This is useful if you want to focus on, for example,
one user at a time and see only that user's items.</p>

<h3>Using the List Option</h3>

<p>To review items by entity (such as a particular user or role),
click <strong>List</strong> in the header row, on the left. This opens a list of the
entities in the review, such as users, roles, or account groups, based on the
type of review. </p>

<p>Click the entity to display only the items for that entity.
The List option also lets you see details about an entity. Click on the tab with
the entity's name to see more information about the entity.</p>

<p>The list view includes a <strong>Search</strong> and <strong>Filter</strong>
options to help you find items in the list. For example, if you search for
users with names beginning with A, you will see just those users in the list
area. However, unless you actually click one of the users' name to select him
or her, the main review page will still show you everyone's items.</p>

<p>To go back to viewing items for all entities, click the <strong>List</strong>
icon again then click <strong>All</strong>. </p>

<h2>Making Access Decisions</h2>

<p>These are the decisions you can make directly on an access
review item:</p>

<p><strong>Approve</strong> the access. This indicates that the user can have
this access; no action will be taken, and the user's access will remain the
same as it is now.</p>

<p><strong>Revoke</strong> the access. When you revoke access, IdentityIQ
removes the access in whatever way the system is configured to do so. Note that
the revocation doesn't necessarily happen immediately. This option is
configured by the person who set up the certification; it can be set up so that
revocation happens as soon as you make the decision, or it can be set up so
that nothing is revoked until the entire certification campaign is complete and 
signed off. If you're unsure about when a revocation will take effect, check with
the owner of the certification.</p>

<p>You may have the option to <strong>revoke an account</strong>. This is
similar to revoking an individual entitlement or role, but it lets you revoke
both the account and all the entitlements associated with the account, at once.
This is a configurable option, so whether you have this option or not will
depend on how the certification was configured.</p>

<p>There is a specific <strong>revoke</strong> option for <strong>separation of duties
policy violations</strong>. This type of violation occurs when a user has two or
more accesses that conflict with each other, in violation of a defined company
policy. For separation of duties policy violations, revoking access involves
choosing which of the conflicting accesses the user will keep, and which will
be revoked.</p>

<p><strong>Allow</strong> an exception to the access. Use this option to allow
access for a fixed period of time, after which the access will be revisited and
potentially revoked- for example, when someone is on a temporary assignment and
needs time-limited access to a system. When you allow access, you may need to choose
an end date for the access, depending on how the certification was configured.
Allowing an exception is always an option on policy violation items, but only
appears for other access review items if the certification is configured to
include this option.</p>

<h3>Item-by-Item vs Bulk Decisions</h3>

<p>The certification can be configured to allow you to make decisions
one at a time, or in bulk; bulk decision-making can be turned off or on, both
per certification, and globally. If bulk decisions are enabled for your review,
a <strong>Bulk Decisions</strong> button appears in the header row of the listing of
items.</p>

<p>To select the items you want to process in bulk, select them
one by one using the checkboxes, or click in the header row to select either
all the items on the current page, or all the items in the entire access
review. You can deselect in the same way.</p>

<p>Once you've chosen your items, click <strong>Bulk Decisions</strong> and
choose whether to approve, revoke, or allow. </p>

<h3>Saving Decisions</h3>

<p>As you make decisions, you are prompted to save them. When
you save decisions you've made, they move from the <strong>Important</strong> or <strong>Open</strong>
tabs to the <strong>Review</strong> tab, where they can still be edited until the review
is signed off.</p>

<h3>Changing Decisions</h3>

<p>Until you have signed off on the review, you can to change
the decisions you have made. You can do this immediately when you make a
decision, before saving it, by re-clicking the decision button or unchecking
the decision from the flyout menu. Once a decision has been saved, you can go
to the <strong>Review</strong> tab and make changes there. Click the 3-line menu beside
the item, then choose <strong>Undo Decision</strong> from the flyout menu. Note that you
have to <strong>Save</strong> changes you make to completed items, just as you do for
open items. Also note that changing certain saved decisions may not be an
option, depending on how the configuration was configured.</p>

<h3>Comments, History, and Details</h3>

<p>Each item in the review can show comments, history and
details. These are accessed via the 3-line menu at the right of the item.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>: You can enter comments at any time on an
item</p>

<p><strong>History</strong>: Shows the history of the review item, including comments
and previous owner history.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong>: Shows details about the access this item applies
to, such as role name, type, and hierarchy for roles or application name, type,
and owner for entitlements. This option is called 'Details' for roles, and
'Account Details' for entitlements.</p>

<h3>Passing Access Reviews to Other Users</h3>

<p>If you need someone else's input on an access review, or you
need someone else to handle the review entirely, you can pass a review to
someone else. There are several ways to do this and each involves different
levels of ownership or responsibility both for you and for the person you pass
it to. Your options for passing a review to others are configured by the system
administrator or certification owner, so you may or may not have all these
options on any given review.</p>

<p><strong>Delegating</strong>: When you delegate a review item to someone
else, they can make the decisions and then return the review to you, so that
you can review it, accept or change their decision, and sign off. With
delegation, the original reviewer still retains ultimate control of the
decision and the sign-off. The certification can be configured to let you
delegate an entire entity, or individual items one by one. To delegate an
entity, click <strong>List</strong> then select the entity and choose <strong>Delegate</strong>
from the <strong>Bulk</strong> menu. To delegate items, click the <strong>3-line menu</strong> for
the item and choose <strong>Delegate</strong>. Choose who to delegate to; you can also add
comments to explain why you've delegated, or to give instructions. <br>
Delegated items are listed in your <strong>Open</strong> tab and are labeled as
delegated. The 3-line menu gives you options for viewing history, details, and
comments.</p>

<p><strong>Reassigning</strong>: Reassigning is different from delegating in
that reassigned items are no longer the responsibility of the original
reviewer. The person the items are reassigned to assumes full responsibility
for all decisions on those items, and must sign off on the decisions
themselves. However, the original owner of the overall access review (that is,
the person doing the reassigning) typically still retains responsibility for
making sure the person the items were reassigned to completes the review. You
can reassign either a whole entity, a single line item, or a specific set of
items in bulk. Reassigning is done through the <strong>Bulk Decisions</strong> option,
even if you only want to reassign one item.<br>
When you reassign items, they no longer appear in your own access review view.
The default behavior for a reassignment is that the person who reassigns the
items cannot sign off on their own review until the reassigned items are
completed and signed off by the person they were reassigned to. However, a
configuration setting in the certification can override this requirement, so
that the original owner can sign off on his or her own review even if some or
all of the reassigned items are still pending.</p>

<p><strong>Forwarding:</strong> Forwarding means you relinquish all
responsibility for the access review. You can't retract or monitor the review -
you pass all responsibility to the new owner, including the ability to change
any decisions you may have already made. Forwarding is done at the overall
review level, from the main access review listing. You can forward an entire
review, but you can't forward individual line items or identities within a
review. <strong>Automatic forwarding</strong> can be set up for an individual, or at the
certification level, and is typically used in an out-of-office scenario.</p>

<h3>Undoing Delegation and Reassignment</h3>

<p>If you need recall a review that you have delegated or
reassigned:</p>

<p>For <strong>delegated items</strong>, click the 3-line menu for the item
and choose <strong>Undo Decision</strong>. When you undo a delegation, any decisions made
by the person you delegated to are undone. You can only undo individual line
item delegations if the items were delegated individually; if you delegated an
entire entity, you can't recall items one by one; you must undo the delegation
of the entire entity.</p>

<p>For <strong>entire entities that were delegated</strong>, go to the <strong>List</strong>
view, click the circular &quot;undo&quot; arrow beside the entity you've delegated, and
undo the delegation. When you undo a delegation, any decisions made by the
person you delegated to are undone.</p>

<p><strong>Items or entities that have been reassigned</strong> work a little
differently. If the person you reassigned something to has made a decision, you
can still undo or change the decision, until the reassignment owner has
completely signed off on his or her review. To change or recall reassigned reviews,
click the <strong>info</strong> icon at the top of the UI, then click <strong>Additional
Reviews</strong>. The initial listing shows all the reviews that have been
reassigned; to <strong>recall</strong> everything that has been reassigned, click the <strong>Return</strong>
button and confirm that you want to return the access review to yourself. You
can also use the <strong>Email</strong> icon to send an email message to the reviewer you
have reassigned the review to. To see <strong>individual items</strong> that have been
reassigned, click on the linked name of the review; items appear on either the
Open tab or on the Review tab, depending on whether or not the new reviewer has
made decisions on them. If the reassigned reviewer has not yet signed off on
the review, you can make or change decisions on each item. If the reassigned
reviewer has signed off on the review, you can still make changes to their
decisions, by using the <strong>Return</strong> button at the entity (&quot;top&quot;) level of the
reassignment, to return the review to yourself.</p>

<h2>Signing Off on a Review</h2>

<p>When decisions have been made for everything in your review,
you can <strong>sign off</strong>. Signing off indicates that the review is fully
complete, and it cannot occur until all items in the access review have been
decided, including any delegated or reassigned items (unless the certification
was specifically configured to allow sign-off despite incomplete reassignments).
Also, if a challenge period is enabled, sign-off can't be completed until the
challenge period is over.</p>

<p>A <strong>green</strong> Sign-Off button on your review means that the
review is complete. A <strong>red</strong> Sign-Off button means that you have finished
the items you are responsible for, but subordinate or reassigned reviews
haven't been completed yet.</p>
