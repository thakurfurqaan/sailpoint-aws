  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between
  revisions.

  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and
  upgradeObjects.xml.  If you have LCM enabled, there are two additional
  files, upgrade-lcm.xml and upgradeObjects-lcm.xml.

  upgrade.xml (this file) is processed in a special way before Hibernate
  is started so that changes can be made at the JDBC level.  upgrade.xml should
  only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the "execute" command to
  call upgrader classes.  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML*

  upgradeObjects.xml is included by upgrade.xml and will be
  imported after Hibernate is started.  Any changes to objects that can be
  respesented as static XML or as ImportActions with the "merge" command
  must go in upgradeObjects.xml to ensure that they are parsed after
  Hibernate has been started so that references can be resolved.

  In upgrade.xml (this file), each action should have a revision attribute
  specified,  which will be checked while upgrading to make sure that
  upgrades aren't run multiple times.  NOTE: revision should be set to the
  NEXT revision number, NOT the current one.

  First the upgraders that are marked as pre-Hibernate are run, then Hibernate
  is started, then the ones marked as post-Hibernate are run.

  After all the upgraders are run and Hibernate is started,
  the upgradeObjects.xml file is imported.

  In some special cases we have upgraders that run after the
  upgradeObjects.xml import.
