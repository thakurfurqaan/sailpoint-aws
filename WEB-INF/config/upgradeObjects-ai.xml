  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between
  revisions.

  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and
  upgradeObjects.xml.  If you have LCM enabled, there are an additional two
  files, upgrade-lcm.xml and upgradeObjects-lcm.xml. If you have IdentityAI
  enabled, there are an additional two files, upgrade-ai.xml and upgradeObjects-ai.xml.

  upgrade.xml, upgrade-lcm.xml and upgrade-ai.xml are processed in a special way before
  Hibernate is started so that changes can be made at the JDBC level.
  These files should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the
  "execute" command to  call upgrader classes.
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML, UPGRADE-LCM.XML OR UPGRADE-AI.XML*

  upgradeObjects-ai.xml is included by upgrade-ai.xml and will be imported after
  Hibernate is started. Any changes to objects that can be respesented as static XML
  or as ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in these files to ensure
  that they are parsed after Hibernate has been started so that
  references can be resolved.
