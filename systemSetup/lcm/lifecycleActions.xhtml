        You came here looking to change the LCM Actions Configuration, but you'll have to do that in xml or from the debug pages now.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        All QuickLinks are now stored in the database. A QuickLink will appear on your dashboard if the identity "matches" a DynamicScope
         and the DynamicScope contains a QuickLinkOptions object relating the two objects together. (Check out init-lcm.xml and 
         search for QuickLinkOptions near the bottom of the file)
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        What used to be called "Request Controls" as system configuration properties, are now stored as Attributes inside the 
        QuickLinkOptions object itself. The only QuickLinks that have Request Controls are "Request Access" and "Manage Account".
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        If you are looking to change the Population Request Authority or Object Request Authority, those configurations are now stored
        on the DynamicScope object itself. Again, you will likely have to look at the init-lcm.xml to see samples of how that works.
        </p>

        <p>
        When all else fails you can email <a href="mailto:scrum-hiltonhead@sailpoint.com">scrum-hiltonhead@sailpoint.com</a> and explain
        what your issue is.
